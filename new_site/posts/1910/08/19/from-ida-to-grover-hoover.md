Hello Mr. Hoover,

Your card received. Was glad you thought of me. Th picture made me homesick to go back. Don't think for a moment that we had forgotten you, no never, not those joy rides, especially the one on Sunday night. Am looking for  a card from Hattie. I could kill John. Love to all,

Ida</body></html>
