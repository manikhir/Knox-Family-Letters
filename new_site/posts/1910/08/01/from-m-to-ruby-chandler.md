Dear Ruby,

We're quite well my man and I. Clara and Maud came home Saturday. The whole bunch of girls were here yesterday after noon. I missed you. When are you coming home? Big ball game yesterday. Chicago beat Detroit 2 to 0. S.S. Convention also all day yesterday. My space is about taken huh. Had to send you birthday greetings.

Love to All,

Auntie M.</p></body></html>
