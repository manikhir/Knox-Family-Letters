Sunday eve. Dec 6 1885

Miss Nettie Knox,

Dear Sisiter Nett,

It is with great pleasure I answer your welcome letter which came to hand yesterday. Was very glad to hear from you and to hear of your arrival safe and sound. Well Nett is a great pleasure to you to be with Anna and folks. Nett I was down home last Sunday. Lizzie was not well but she breached up in the eve. That fellow from Greene was coming over. His name is Alverson. I didn't see him. We left before he came. Nett when I was down home there was a fellow come in the house to Ma with tears in his eyes. Ma says what is the matter Lige. He says Mrs. Knox when is Nettie coming home. He said he didnt know whether he could stand it any longer or no. I felt sorry for the poor fellow and he joined the church too. Oh he is going to be a good boy and do so much. Nett it seems like you have been gone six months. It seemed so lonesome when I was home, Nett it made me feel so bad because I did not see you before you left. I had no idea of you going so soon. I went to Roadhouse with Smith white at Pearl. Maggie sent by me and got her a blue like your brown dress. Its a beauty. Maggie and Lizzie has got pretty hats. Smith went over to Milton the other evening and got ma a handsome white hood. Oh its a daisy. Nett they are having fly times on the bottom now. I seen Maggie Hawk and Roth. They were very anxious that you would come over and spend the most of winter over here so you would all have a good time. Lucy is still at Crabtree's. She was here the day after I got the letter from you. She said she was going to write to you. Nett they had a big meeting over the river, recently had a big time everybody fined. Harve's will have to quit having dances. There isn't enough girls left to dance on that side of the river. Clem, Alt, and Belle all fined and I know not how many others. Mrs. Trulmes fined too. I think if it had continued a while lounger Harle and Carry would have gone up. Milam and wife went up, it was the sanctified Methodist. McLaughlin and six of course you know them they got 30 additions to the church while here, oh yes they are going to build a new church right off. Nick and Delia went in to the fold he donated $2.00 and a lot to build on. They say they have $7.00 made up for building purposes now. Lizzie has been home sick during the two weeks meeting and was there every night she wasn't ver sick. She went back down to Pearl. Ma had another girl, Ma says a splendid girl she was too and of course Ma let the other girl o and Lizzie was laying around there no able to do anything and so much to do when I was down there it made me about half made when Ma could have a good girl and did not keep here. Lizzie is sick very near all the time lately. Nett old Erve Young went to Ken. and got hims wife. She aint a bit bad looking either. I seen her and Jennie and got an introduction to her. She was an old maid. Well Nett remember me as your oldest sister with five little children. 3 girls and 2 boys, they all wish to see you very much. Nett tell Will I think he might write me. Asa says to give his love to Uncle Will and say he would like to see him. Well Nett I guess I wrote foolishness enough this time. Nett when you read this don't go out and pull up great handfuls of grass. Nett write us a big long letter. we all join in sending our love to you as if separately named. Kiss the children for their poor auntie and children that would love to see them.

I remain your kind true sis.
