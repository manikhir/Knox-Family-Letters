My best regards to all the folks

Dear Miss Grace,

I have often wondered if I would ever hear from you and at last the pleasure is mine. Saw your Papa a few days ago and he told me you were getting along O.K. Everybody is fine here. Weather, simply divine. Let me hear from you again.

Yours,

Caston</body></html>
