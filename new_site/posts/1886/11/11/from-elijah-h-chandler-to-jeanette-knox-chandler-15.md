Dearest Nettie,

Your kind letter of 11th received, will answer this morning. I received your letter the next day after you wrote it but thought I would wait til Sunday to answer. It's getting so cold can't write after night very well. I was at Church last night. This will be the last night if they don't get any converts. Two weeks last night since they commenced they have got one to join the church and two more. I guess you loam up in grand style with that new coat. Better kook our or you might out grow it. Then you would have to buy another one but you could come to Pearl and get small again. I don't know how I am weighing now aint had any scales all winter. Have to guess at everything I ship. Sink &amp; Shea got back from their 2nd trip to Pittsfield last night. I do not know how they made it but they were under 15 hundred dollars last account. Your Pa got home Friday night. Don't think Shea done any thing with the report I told you about in my last letter. The Sheriff came to Pearl last night after eve. I don't know who he was after. He stayed all night at your house. Millie Rose is in Pearl again. HS mad a mash at the night Opr. Mr. Wheeling is here with a  lot of old goods selling at Auction for man by name of Ladow.

Pusby Stephouson has made a solid match on the Milliner's Miss Hormidy. Alex Stephouson has took John Myriser's place selling fruit trees. Belly Maynard is working on the bridge. Him this girl has played out again. Lizzie Frazier is up at Mr. Hess' yet. This is about all that I know to write this time. Am having a very good time going to Church but don't get away from depot til dark every night. I wish you was at home then. I think I would have a good time. I know I would. Do you have any idea what month you will come home in. Write soon. Regards to all

Yours Truly

E.H. Chandler
