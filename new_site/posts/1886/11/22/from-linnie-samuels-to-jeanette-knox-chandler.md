Miss Nettie Knox

My Dear Friend,

I will now attempt to answer your most esteemed letter which I received Saturday morning. I was very glad to hear from you and that you were thinking of returning to Iowa, and also to hear of your brother. The Riverton young people miss him so much and now they are very lonesome without Miss L. Ellis and mr. Talbott to liven up the parties for they made everything lively when they were about. I am all alone today. Mamma went to Hamburg yesterday and today she has gone over to Mrs. Thompson after some plums and I stayed home to cook dinner for some men that were working here. Brother Joe and Mr. Wes Cowlas came down from Sidney today and they said everybody were well there. Miss Nettie - Among the first you go to visit must be myself. That is, if I do not go off to school before you come.

When you come I will have a party while you are here and have the Sidney and Riverton young folks come and those you know at hamburg. You may bet we will have a fly time while you are with one.

I ask your pardon for not answering sooner for Sunday. I had company all day and yesterday I was making a dress.

Misses Katie and Crissie Thompson started for Lexington, Mo. to attend school and Miss Jennie began to teach school yesterday and they feel very lonesome without thereon during the evening. Jennie teaches in the Riverton school.

It is getting very late and I will have to close with my very best regards to you and all the family.

I remain

Your True Friend

Linnie S.</body></html>
