Dear Sister Nettie,

Yours received. Did think when I wrote that I would come to Sidney today, but give the trip up as I think that Johnnie will come out to Ima soon and we will come down then. I would like to come down so as to congratulate among the boys over the major election but the expense is to much when a person thinks of it. I am now taking my regulars at this hotel. Have been here about two weeks, like the place very well with the exception of the room. It is too small for any use. Have not heard from home since I wrote you. Am expecting a letter soon. Write me at your convenience soon and give me all the Sidney news.

Regards to all inquiring friends.

Your Bro,

Will</body></html>
