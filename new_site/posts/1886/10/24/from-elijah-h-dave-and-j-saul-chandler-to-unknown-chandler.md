Dear Brother,

Yours of the 26 is received. Was glad to hear from you and hear you and all was well. I was sorry to hear of the Death of Mactard Bell Allen but we have all got to Dye some time. That we may be fine forever here after. I truly hope you will have a good time when you get married. I hope you will not have any brake up before the day comes. Well I have some news to write of any importance.

Today is Sunday I just got back from hunting. I got 2 turkeys. Will have a good dinner tomorrow. There is 30 miles of the R.R. done. 40 more will come to precut. Not much mining going on at present. Everybody in good spirit. I think we will have a break in the spring. Will close hopping to hear from you soon.

Goodbye,

J. Saul Chandler
