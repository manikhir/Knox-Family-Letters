Dear Friend,

I once more scratch you a few lines in remembrance to you that I have not forgotten your smiling face yet nor do I think I will soon. But I guess you have thought nothing of poor Bub. You are seeing all the fun you can wish for I suppose. I have had no fun since I saw you last. I guess you are aware that I wrote to you last and not knowing as you was mad or not I thought I would like to find out. Hope you will not be offended by my writing to you with out your answer. I would like to see you the best kind. When do you think you will come home or do you think you will ever come back and see the people here. I guess you have made a grand mash out there and think nothing about the boys here. Hope you will get back by the fourth. Are you married or not - hope not. I am not but would like to be. I will close hoping to hear from you sooner. Best regards to Mr. Roush and family, nettie Knox, and all loving kindness to yourself

I beg pardon if not requested.

As ever your true friend

W.L. Fulmer
