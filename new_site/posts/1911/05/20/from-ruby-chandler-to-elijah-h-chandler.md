Dear Papa,

This is a picture taken at the aviation meet here when we first came. A friend of Vinnie's took us in his auto to the ball game yesterday afternoon. Omaha vs. Wichita. A great game. We sent a package home yesterday. A book for Margaret and Lucerne. Tell Lucerne to read to Margaret.

Love to all,
