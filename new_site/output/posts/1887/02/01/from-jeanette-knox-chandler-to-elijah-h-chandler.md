Mr. E.H. Chandler

My Dearest Friend,

Your most welcome letter received last eve and perused with the greatest of pleasure and now I will try to write a few lines in answer. It seems if you have the same kind of weather there as we have here, I will get to take a sleigh ride with you sure enough if it does not turn warm and thaw the snow off before I get there. It is snowing very fast this am and there is a good deal of snow already on the ground. There is no fear of my changing my mind about coming home for I am only to anxious to get started. I expect I had better  wire you what time I will start. Annie think stat would be best. I am truly sorry to hear of you suffering so much with your tooth. Annie say's for me to tell you that she said for you to have that tooth taken out immediately.  So I guess you had better do so.  I have not received my money from home yet as Maggie said she would send it in next letter. I expect it today or tomorrow. Then after that gets here there is no telling what time I will rack out for home but I should say, rather shortly. I have felt sorry many times because I did not answer that letter of yours because since then, instead of getting two letters from you, I only get one in the same length of time and it seems such along time to wait for one letter comes until I get another from you, but Oh! how nice to think, we will soon see each other and then can talk instead of writing. Not that I tire of writing oh no - I have always found that a pleasure. But it will give me more pleasure still, to see and talk to you. I suppose the fox chase was quite an exciting affair for the people of Peal and other towns. But I fear the next report I hear of it will be that the crowd all stayed at Pearl the most of the night and got drunk and had a general tear up. That is what I expect to hear in next report. Yes - if Johnie had sen there he would also have been in the five and I think Nettie would have been too, if she had been there. Does Joe try to go with anybody? When I was at home the girls (Lizzie and Maggie) said he had been going some with May Hess. But I never seen them together while I was there. That is too bad that Matt Mulligan was so unfortunate as to loose his position as night watch by that explosion. I suppose he can not get a job at the grocery store any more at all. Well I am surprised to hear of Sell Strunk's break, as I was in hopes Sell would change his ways after George's death and after his joining the church but it seems he has failed. Well now I will close. John has just returned from the office and I did not get a letter from Maggie. Write soon.

Yours Lovingly,

Nettie</body></html>
