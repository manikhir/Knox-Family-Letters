Dear Nettie

Your kind letter of 21st. Just saw and read with great pleasure. I will try to answer this eve. I was in hopes the next letter I got from you I would hear you was going to be for home right away. Well two weeks want be very long to want because I am very anxious to see you. I went to the festival the other night and had a very good time but didn't have any pictures. I am just about sick today and have been for two or three days. I was up till about one o'clock the night of the festival. Then Winslaw woke me at 2:30 to work for him. He came to St. Louis. So I had to work that day and till 12:15 the next night. So I guess that is what the matter with me. The men have had a bad time this pat day. It was raining and many of them were at work. So, the most of them got stuck or usual. This is a fine day and all the men are at work and I am glad of it. I get disgusted with lots of old drunken men. Well, I do wish you had come home in time to have taken  sleigh ride. maybe it will snow again before winter's close. If it doesn't I expect it will snow next winter but I don't like to wait so I'll leave it at that. I am at a loss to know what to write today, nothing worth writing about. Oh, certainly I will excuse you for not answering that letter as you was busy and fixing to come home. But not for anything else. Well I guess I will have to close for want of something to write. But never mind I will pay up when you come home. Yes be sure to let me know when you are coming. I would be happy to come meet you. Hoping to heat from you again soon.

I am Yours Truly,

E.H. Chandler
