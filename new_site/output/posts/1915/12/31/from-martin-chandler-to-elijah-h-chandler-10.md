Dearest Folks,

Pretty slow traveling here. Am on First Lines. Have some thought of getting job on this line. If I do it will be permanent. They have no schedule here and when they put a man to work its permanent. Am 170 miles from Houston. If don't get job will be there Sunday or Monday.

Lovingly,

Martin</body></html>
