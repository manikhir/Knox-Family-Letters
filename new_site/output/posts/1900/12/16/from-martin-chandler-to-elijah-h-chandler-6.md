Dearest Folks,

Getting along OK. Leave here today. Sure hope I can get a job. it's pretty cold down here but don't mind it much. Rather be traveling this way than to be laying round in Pearl. Sure would like to hear from yours. I can imagine what you all think of me for leaving this way especially while Grace and Lorin were there but think I'd rather be most anywhere than Pearl.

Next time I write I'll give you an address and want to hear from some of you.

Lovingly,

Martin</body></html>
