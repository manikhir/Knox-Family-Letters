From: Betty and Harold, To: Millie



Monday

Dearest Aunt Millie,

Again I say I am sorry because I have waited so long to write. About August 10th I took Meiser to Colorado in order to avoid hay fever season in Kans. In less than a week after that I received a long distance phone call from Harold's doctor in Hearth Platte, Nebraska telling me Harold was seriously ill in hospital with pneumonia. Louie's wife went to Colorado to care for mother and I left Colo. for He. Platte and joined Harold. He was well enough to leave He. Platte in about three weeks. So we left and we came to Kansas City to see this Dr. Jere who operated on Harold five years ago. We were mistaken about Harold being able to make the trip to Kansas City so back to hospital we went again where he remained another two weeks. He is conversating now and Wed. of this week we go to Topeka for three weeks more of rest. Meier is being brought to Topeka today from Colorado. I am well considering every thing I have seen thru this summer.

I do hope dear you are comfortable and that hay fever did not get you down this summer. Also hope your little dog is well and still with you as I know he is company for you.

Bertie is busy as ever. Louie returned from Europe early last spring and will make no more trips abroad til peace is definitely declared over there which I fear is a long ways off.

Weather here now is beautiful but we had a very hot summer as Ks. always does have.

Hope to hear from you soon and that the report of you health will be favorable.

Lots of love from both of us.

Betty &amp; Harold
