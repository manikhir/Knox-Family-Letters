Wednesday, a.m.

Dearest -

On G's card you'll find the desired information. Ruby was telling me how you dressed - or rather didn't dress to go see Dr. off on the train. R will be out tonight to chair practice. Think I'll ask Mr. Burrows out to help us eat fish tonight. I owe him a dinner and we're expecting the fish in this a.m.
