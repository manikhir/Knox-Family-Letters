Christmas 1927

To Mrs. Nettie Chandler and Family

Pearl, Illinois

Nettie I know how hard it is for those who are grief stricken by the loss of those near and dear to them, to participate in the joy and happiness of the Christmas Holiday.

But we must meet the decree of the Almighty. Separation of the closest must be.

Be brave, and meet life's great tasks, happy in the assurance that your husband and father had many friends, knowing his worth, and that you have many friends who as well as I, wish you and yours much joy and happiness.

Your old teacher and friend,

N.C. McEvers

Please supply the address to Annie's letter and mail it for me.</body></html>
