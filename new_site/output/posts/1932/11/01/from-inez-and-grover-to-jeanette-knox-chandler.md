Dear Aunt Nett,

Just a few lines to thank you for your nice letter which we recieved some time ago. We are getting along nicely but it is sure lonely without my dear Mother. I don't think I'll ever get over missing her. Ruby has been so loyal to use. I don't know what we would have done without here. G.C. worked at the elections board yesterday and isn't home yet this a.m. Roosevelt sure went over big. I hope he can do something for us.

We wish you would come out here again this winter and make us a nice visit.

Mae was down for a week or more, fixing up the house on Holyoke. It is for rent again. Write when convenient.

Much Love,

Inez and Grover</body></html>
