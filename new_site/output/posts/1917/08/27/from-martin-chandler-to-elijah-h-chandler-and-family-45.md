Dearest Papa, Mama, and all

Received 2 letters from papa since returning from hike last Saturday evening and sure glad to get them. We went up into New Mexico on the hike. Had a dandy time. The company was split up and strung out through the country and we had continuos wire communication which we put up ourselves. I stayed on duty until midnight. A and C company were along too. A company is the Radio outfit. They put up their wireless apparatus and were in communication with El Paso all the time. They also had a wire strung to our camp and out company relayed all messages for El Paso to the Radio Co and they sent them by wireless to El Paso and Ft. Bliss.

The man who brought Papa's letter to me yesterday saw that it was from Pearl and asked me if I knew anyone there. I told him I lived there and he said he was from White Hall. He sleeps in tent next to mine. He is a step brother of Pearl Ellis and said he remembered Ruby and Pearl were at their house one time. His name is Fitzjarrellz. He is Corporal in the company and a nice fellow. He also knows Uncle Will's family at Manchester and used to go with Lucille. Sure surprised me to meet him. Said he had been at Pearl lots of times playing ball and coming to boat shows and knows lots of the fellows around Pearl. He's the only fellow I've ran across close from home. Our battalion played baseball with 2nd telegraph battalion yesterday and beat them 7 to 3. Captain was sure pleased. I had m picture taken in ball suit with another fellow. Just a Kodak. Will send you one soon as they are finished. Mama did you ever find the Kodaks in my suit case?

Well its just 5 min until drill time and I've been writing this in an awful hurry so could get it off this am.

Hope everybody is OK. Well write again soon.

Lovingly,

Martin</body></html>
