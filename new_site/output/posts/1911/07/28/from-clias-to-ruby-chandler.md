Hello Ruby,

I found my rooming house but had to think some. The address is 204 W. Mulberry instead of 409.

I have a fine place to room. I have a good time but expect to have a better one after I get better adjusted. I expect you are making big preparations for the pow wow. Don't forget to write  soon kind of an answer as I get anxious to hear from you. Hello to all.
